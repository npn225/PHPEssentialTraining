This is a compilation of all the work I have done for the PHP Essential Training Course on with K. Skoglund on the Lynda.com site.  
All of the files created/edited by me start with the letters "NN" and are found throughout all the chapter folders.  
A copy of all the files I personally have touched can be found in the folder called "Chapter_NN" within the Exercises Folder.
